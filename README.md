# Hotel-Accomodation-and-Ordering-System
This repository is based on my first C++ Project-"Hotel Accomodation and Ordering System".
This project I developed under my learning phase of C++ when I had learnt basics enough to practically implement it.
This is Hotel_Accomodation and Ordering System which takes input as your name , mobile number and valid ID no and asks for a room accomodation and then directs you to menu driven Snacks ordering system in which one can choose from given options and at the end the final invoice is generated including chargers for ordered food and taxes and is finally presented to the user.
